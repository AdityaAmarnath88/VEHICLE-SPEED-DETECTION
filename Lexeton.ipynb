    "### Our lives are deeply engrossed in finishing tasks, researching, household chores,etc. Usually we need some materialistic things for fulfilling our needs. One of such items is a car. A car is a daily necessity for the transportation of goods,capital and people. Being widely under use, it has several advantages like quickening our lives, but can also have several disadvantages like accidents leading to death. To reduce such car accidents on highways, city roads,etc. We have built an amazing AI project that will deeply analyze the speed of cars and if found too high then it will to reported to the police.
